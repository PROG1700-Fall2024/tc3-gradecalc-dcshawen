# Grade Point Calculator

# Create a console-based program that will take a letter grade, such as B+ or C, and convert it to its 
# corresponding numeric value. It will use two prompts, one for the letter grade and a second for the
# modifier, if any (+ or -), and calculate, then output the proper number grade.

# •	Possible letter grades are A, B, C, D, and F
# •	Possible numeric values are 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respective to the letters listed above.
# •	Possible modifiers are a plus (+), a minus (–) or nothing. 
# •	There is no F+ or F–. 
# •	Using the + sign increases the numeric value by 0.3, using the – sign decreases it by 0.3. However, an A+ has 
#       still has a value of only 4.0. 
# •	A valid letter grade can be either uppercase or lowercase.
# •	If an invalid value is entered, display a warning message.
